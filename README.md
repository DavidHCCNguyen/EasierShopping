## Project Description
```
The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly online shopping application that enables regular online shoppers to purchase their favorite items from the convenience of their homes. The application will have a login page that allows users to sign in as members or as guests. 

Upon signing in, users will be presented with a list of products on offer, each with its respective image and description. The application will include an auto-complete function for regular shoppers, which will save them time and effort when typing in their details to log in or sign up. 

When users click on a product of interest, the application will automatically create a new list of shopping items or add to an already existing list to the right of the window. If the user accidentally leaves the application and returns, they will be presented with their existing list of shopping items without needing to start shopping from the beginning.

The application will also allow users to change their order by deleting items using a remove button option. Once the user has completed their shopping, they can click the proceed to checkout button and a modal will appear to confirm their purchase was completed successfully.

Overall, this project aims to improve the online shopping experience for regular shoppers by making the process more efficient, convenient, and user-friendly.
